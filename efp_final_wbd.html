<ul>
    <li>These types of organizations play a detrimental role in solving an issue like this as they have had real genuine impacts on families and communities.</li>
    <li>Their philosiphy of healing through culture is a neccessity when solving an issue like this as it helps heal the trauma they may have experienced in the child welfare system.</li>
    <li>They understand the importance behind solving an issue like this as the organzition run by an indigenous community so many of them have also had to endure against injustices of similar nature.</li>
    <li>However they could be doing much more as the Ontario government shorted them around 18 million dollars which could have been used to help many more in need.</li>
