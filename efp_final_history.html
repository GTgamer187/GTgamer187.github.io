<h3>Why Are There so Many Children</h3>
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; max-width: 69%;">
<ul>
    <li>Indigenous families in poverty have been unjustly targeted during this crisis.</li>
    <li>Impoverished Indigenous communities do not have the resources to fight back against the government.</li>
    <li>They have been disporotionately affected time and time again, revealing a vicious cycle.</li>
    <li>These families have been unproportionately affected by the government not only during the present but also during the 1960's with the "60's scoop" and with the times of residental schools.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What is The Issue Behind This</h3>
</div>

<ul>
    <li>The issue of there being an excessive number of Indigenous children in foster care mirrors the practices and outcomes of the "Sixties Scoop.".</li>
    <li>Indigenous children in the Foster care system are often not allowed to speak their mother language and are dissallowed from cultural practices.</li>
    <li>The "Sixties Scoop" is regarding a time during the 1960's where thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their homes by the government out of prejudice.</li>
    <li>The ongoing cycle of cultural loss and trauma needs to stop and can be through the completion of this Call to Action and the Canadian governments reconciliation.</li>
